You can set the job authorization scope to be collection or project. Important: If the scope is not restricted at either the organization level or project level, then every job in your YAML pipeline gets a collection scoped job access token. In other words, your pipeline has access to any repository in any project of your organization.

DevOps does a great job in automating the development and deployment process, but since all moving parts (containers, libraries etc.) are being updated frequently, it is imperative to make sure the infrastructure where you deploy your code is safe. The best way to do that is to incorporate vulnerability scanning into your pipeline. A vulnerability scanner is a computer program designed to assess computers, networks or applications for known weaknesses. These scanners are used to discover the weaknesses of a given system. They are utilized in the identification and detection of vulnerabilities arising from mis-configurations or flawed programming within a network-based asset such as a firewall, router, web server, application server, etc. Learn more: https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-guideline/latest/02e-Infrastructure-Vulnerability-Scanning https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/vulnerability-assessment\nRecommendation (Remediation Steps):\n1.

Limit job authorization scope to current project for your pipeline. You can set the job authorization scope to be collection or project. Important: If the scope is not restricted at either the organization level or project level, then every job in your YAML pipeline gets a collection scoped job access token. In other words, your pipeline has access to any repository in any project of your organization. If an adversary is able to gain access to a single pipeline in a single project, they will be able to gain access to any repository in your organization. This is why, it is recommended that you restrict the scope at the highest level (organization settings) in order to contain the attack to a single project.
